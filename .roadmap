Features to add:
  - A `-f / --file` flag that will allow users to supply a file named something other than dovetail.yaml as an argument
  - Add the ability to provide custom variables as arguments which will populate templated cmds in the yaml
  - Start adding branches for the different releases and stuff (like noble, jammy debs, and maybe the snaps as well)
  - Add rust linting
  - Add environment variables
  - Add color coded output / improve it generally
