Features to add:
  - A `-f / --file` flag that will allow users to supply a file named something other than dovetail.yaml as an argument
  - Add the ability to provide custom variables as arguments which will populate templated cmds in the yaml
  - Start adding branches for the different releases and stuff (like noble, jammy debs, and maybe the snaps as well)
  - Add rust linting
  - Add environment variables
  - Add color coded output / improve it generally
  - Maybe add a setup command which searches for a setup environment. This could be used to for example install the project dependencies / stuff for tests
  - Opposite of depends. A post directive which runs another environment after the current
