# Dovetail

Dovetail is a workflow manager designed to streamline the management of tasks across multiple projects and environments. Particularly, it helps by allowing users to supply custom user-defined environments such as development, staging, and production environments, the actions to be taken, configurations to apply, and environment variables to source.

## Key Features
- Seamless Environment Management: Easily handle different environment variables for various environments like development, staging, and production.
- Command Simplification: Effortlessly run complex or lengthy commands by defining them once, and then executing them with simple commands such as `dovetail run <environment>`
- Declarative Setup: Define your workflow in a consistent and declarative manner, making it easy to set up, tear down, and reproduce environments.
- Extensibility: Dovetail is designed to be fully extensible, allowing you to define custom environments and actions according to your project's needs.
